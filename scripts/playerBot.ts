/**
 * The player bot has three guessing algorithms
 * If the player bot is the first to guess in a round
 * the sign parameter should be 0.
 * If it's not the first guess of the round, the sign parameter
 * should be 1 if the guess should be higher and -1 if
 * the guess should be lower.
 * To make the algorithms better also supply the lastGuess
 * parameter which should be the number the previous player
 * guessed.
